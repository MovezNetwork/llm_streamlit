1,"If everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change. Climate change will mostly affect us young people because we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do. You can also find out which foods are especially harmful to the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).",BU08,BU0820240809105828,"tst\_sentence: ""Y'know, cutting back on meat, it's not just a little thing! It can really help with that CO2 stuff and the climate changes we've been seeing. Imagine, if you swap out that meat at every meal for something else just one day in a year, it's like driving to China and back! Small changes, like saying 'no' to meat once a day, can make a difference now. Why not give it a shot, buddy?""
